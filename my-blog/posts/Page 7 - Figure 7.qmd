Note: Poverty rates are reported for the $3.00, $4.20, and $8.30 per person per day poverty lines (expressed in 2021 purchasing power parity dollars). Between 2024 and 2029 poverty is projected based on per capita gross domestic product growth projections in Global Economic Prospects, June 2024 (World Bank 2024c) complemented by the Macro Poverty Outlook, Spring Meetings 2024 (World Bank 2024e) and the World Economic Outlook (IMF 2024); for 2030, average annual historic per capita growth rates (2010–19) are used. The black horizontal dotted line is drawn at 3 percent and indicates the World Bank’s target of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
